Within the last decade, two security standards have taken center stage to provide guidance and support for the implementation of robust security infrastructure. These standards are OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect. 
In this presentation, Vladimir Bychkov will cover the basics of these security protocols, explain and demo the authorization flows for different types of applications and provide tips for implementation of centralized authorization service using ASP.NET Core.
